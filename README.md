# QuickStep

AccelStepper is a library for Arduino that allows you to control stepper motors, but is has flaws.

QuickStep is an alternative that:
- is x% faster than AccelStepper (see picture)
- Includes acceleration when running multiple motors with ease.
- Can do interpolation to create smooth paths.
